# TODO

- Write tests for remaining opcodes
- Write tests for input pins
- Implement remaining icescript commands
- First pass performance profiling of transistor-level emulation
- Tool for exploring netlist "neighborhoods"
- Analyze signal direction to find pass transistors; separate simulation into "edges"
