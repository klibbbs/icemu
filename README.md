# ICEMU

ICEMU is a transistor-accurate IC emulator, [heavily influenced by the perfect6502 and visual6502 projects](#credits).

# Credits

ICEMU is inspired by and derived from [perfect6502](https://github.com/mist64/perfect6502), written by Michael Steil, which in turn was derived from [visual6502](https://github.com/trebonian/visual6502), written by Greg James, Brian Silverman, and Barry Silverman.

See original licenses for derived code in the [MOS6502 layout](mos6502/layout.h) and the core [transistor emulation logic](icemu.c).
